This plugin enables you to create immersive multimedia stories in minutes using videos, pictures, text paragraphs and audio form the web.

== Description ==

Metta helps you turn your stories into short movies or video lessons. Use online videos, pictures, text, sound or voiceover (from web sources as well as the hard drive) and create a new story out of them. Insert polls and quizzes into your videos to get instant feedback from your audience. You can organize your story in chapters; each chapter has a timeline that can be divided into sections by using breakpoints. Than easily fill sections with media by simply dragging collected items into it.
